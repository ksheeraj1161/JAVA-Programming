the first 50 Fibonacci numbers. Set the priority of thread that computes Fibonacci number to 9
and the other to 5. After calculating 30 Fibonacci numbers, make that thread to sleep and take up
natural number computation. After computing the 15 natural numbers continue the Fibonacci
number computing.

student grade is “A”. If the CGPA of a student is between 70 and 90, then categorize
the student grade is “B”.
If the CGPA of a student is between 50 and 70, then categorize
the student grade is “C”.

100), (B2, 200), (B3, 300), (B4, 400) and (B5, 500). Remove the third Key and Value pair from the Map,
also update the cost of B4 value as 800. Traverse through the Map elements using lambda expression.
