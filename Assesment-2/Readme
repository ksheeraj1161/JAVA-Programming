Sample Output:
False 
Write a Java program to test if the first and the last element of two array of 
integers are same. The length of the array must be greater than or equal to 
Test Data: array1 = 50, -20, 0, 30, 40, 60, 12 
array2 = 45, 20, 10, 20, 30, 50, 11 
Sample Output:
false 
Write a Java program to create a new array of length 2 from two arrays of 
integers with three elements and the new array will contain the first and last 
elements from the two arrays Test Data: array1 = 50, -20, 0 
array2 = 5, -50, 10 
Sample Output:
Array1: [50, -20, 0] 
Array2: [5, -50, 10] 
New Array: [50, 10] 
 Write a Java program to test that a given array of integers of length 2 
contains a 4 or a 7. 
Sample Output:
Original Array: [5, 7] 
true 
 Write a Java program to rotate an array (length 3) of integers in left direction. 
Sample Output:
Original Array: [20, 30, 40] 
Rotated Array: [30, 40, 20] 
Write a Java program to get the larger value between first and last element of 
an array (length 3) of integers . 
Sample Output:
Original Array: [20, 30, 40] 
Larger value between first and last element: 40 
Write a Java program to swap the first and last elements of an array (length 
must be at least 1) and create a new array. 
 Sample Output:
Original Array: [20, 30, 40] 
New array after swaping the first and last elements: [40, 30, 
20] Write a Java program to find the largest element between first, last, and 
middle values from an array of integers (even length). 
 Sample Output:
Original Array: [20, 30, 40, 50, 67] 
Largest element between first, last, and middle values: 67 
Write a Java program to multiply corresponding elements of two arrays of 
integers. 
Sample Output:
Array1: [1, 3, -5, 4] 
 
Array2: [1, 4, -5, -2] 
Result: 1 12 25 -8

Write a program to demonstrate the knowledge of students in multidimensional arrays 
and looping constructs. Eg., If there are 4 batches in BTech - “CSE1007” course, read the count of the slow 
learners (who have scored <25) in each batch. Tutors should be assigned in the ratio of 
1:4 (For every 4 slow learners, there should be one tutor). Determine the number of 
tutors for each batch. Create a 2-D jagged array with 4 rows to store the count of slow 
learners in the 4 batches. The number of columns in each row should be equal to the 
number of groups formed for that particular batch ( Eg., If there are 23 slow learners in 
a batch, then there should be 6 tutors and in the jagged array, the corresponding row 
should store 4, 4, 4, 4, 4,3). Use for-each loop to traverse the array and print the details. 
Also print the number of batches in which all tutors have exactly 4 students. 
There are 12 10 and 8 instructional days for a particular course before CAT-1, CAT-2 and Termend 
examinations respectively. Declare a 2-dimensional jagged array with 3 rows to store the entire 
attendance details of a single student in that course, where in the first row must have 12 elements, 
second row- 10 elements and third row- 8 elements. Assuming the array elements contain any of the 2 
values ‘1’ / ‘0’ denoting Present/Absent, Write a Java program to evaluate the attendance percentage 
for his CAT-1, CAT-2 and Term-end period (all the three terms taken together). Use enhanced-for 
loops to traverse the array. 
Write a Java program with class definition for ‘Employee’ with emp-name, emp-id, salary and 
joining-date and required methods as members of the class. Create an array of objects of ‘emp’ for 
‘n’ number of employees in VIT. Write a Java program to display the emp-name and emp-id of 
employees who have salary less than INR100000 and sort the emp-name and display the Employee 
details based on salary in ascending order.
Write a Java program to find the sum of the elements of a two dimensional array of integers 
and floating point numbers with method overloading. 
Consider an example of declaring the examination result. Design three classes: Student, 
Exam and Result. The Student class has data members such as registration number, name etc. 
Create a class Exam by inheriting the student class. The Exam class adds data members 
representing the marks scored in six subjects. Derive class Result from the Exam class and it 
has own data members such as total_marks. Write an interactive program in Java to model 
this relationship
