Create a package named Pack1, with a class ‘Words’. Create another package Pack2 inside Pack1 with a class ‘Length’ in it.                         
                              
a. In the ‘Words’ class, define a method countNumWords() that will count the number of words in the given text.
b. In the ‘Length’ class, define a method strLength() to find the length of the string without using length() function.
c. Define the main class and import the packages and call the methods under the classes Words, Length respectively.                        


Write a Java program to demonstrate multiple inheritance with two interfaces and a class with main class to find sum of n numbers and factorial of a given number.

Create an interface called Newspaper. In the interface, create a method called news ().
Implement interface Newspaper by class Magazine.
Implement interface Newspaper by class Brochure.
The method news () in each class display the following information.
  In Magazine class : String title, integer ISBN, String editor
  In Brochure class:  String title, integer year, integer page_number.


Create an abstract class called Student which includes the following for each student:
Name
Status (full time, part time)
Telephone
Then implement an abstract method which determines the amount paid by the student which varies between full time and part time students. (Tuition fees- full-time students paying a flat fee of $2,000 and part-time students paying $200 per credit hour. ). Create two child classes and call them FullTimeStudent and PartTimeStudent. Write a Java program by creating objects of the two child classes and display the data fields for each object.

A travel agency offers executive travel package for a month by giving 15% off on rate for male above 65 years of age and 20% off for female above 60 years of age and 10% off to couples if female is above 18 years and male is above 21years . Create a User defined Exception class so that if the age and gender of the person is not matching with the norms of the agency it throws an exception else it offers the concession to the customer.        

Create a class MyCalculator which consists of a single method long power(int, int). This method takes two integers, n and  p, as parameters and finds  np. If either n or  p is negative, then the method must throw an exception which says "n and p should not be negative". Also, if both n and  p are zero, then the method must throw an exception which says " n and p should not be be zero"For example, -4 and -5 would result in  java.lang.Exception: n and p should not be negative. Write a Java program for the function power in class MyCalculator and return the appropriate result after the power operation or an appropriate exception as detailed above.
